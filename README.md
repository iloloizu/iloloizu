Welcome! My name is Ilolo Izu (e-lo-lo e-zu), known some places by my first name—Justin! I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in the Medical Field. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree focused in Allied Health with a Minor in Business Administration from Texas A&M University in December 2019. I have created three web applications in Javascript, React, SQLite, and Ruby. Some examples are a health and wellness calendar/to-do list and a wishlist app. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, SQL, Ruby, Object-Oriented Programming, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, Heroku, SQLite, PostgreSQL, RSpec, MVC Software Architecture, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects.

I'm looking for Frontend Software Engineering roles primarily, and secondly for roles as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I am very interested in being in an environment where I can grow, learning languages such as Python, three.js, Java, C#, C++, Vue.js, etc, or bettering my growing interest in UI/UX.

I also have an interest in real estate investing and entrepreneurship. On the side, I also am a freelance videographer, photographer, and digital editor. I have been taking photoshoots for over 4 years now and shooting and editing videos for nearly 15 years.

In my free time, I also coach younger athletes in the sport of track and field. I find this to be a great way to give back to the community all the knowledge I've learned as a 4x NCAA All-American athlete.

Myers Briggs: INFJ
I'm honestly a very personable guy, I love getting to know whom I'm working with and I recognize that people hire people, to work with people. I think that the best work happens surrounded by dedicated like-minded individuals. Much comparable to my experience in track & field and Maroon Coats, I was able to learn to work with people from all over the world, which I know will benefit me for years to come.
