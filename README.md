# Hi, I'm Ilolo 👋🏾👨🏾‍💻

<img src="./iloloGithub.png">

Welcome to my Github! My name is Ilolo Izu (e-lo-lo e-zu), known some places by my first name—Justin! I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in the Medical Field. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree focused in Allied Health with a Minor in Business Administration from Texas A&M University in December 2019.

After attending a coding bootcamp, Flatiron School, I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, SQL, Ruby, Object-Oriented Programming, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, Heroku, SQLite, PostgreSQL, RSpec, MVC Software Architecture, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects.

I'm looking for Frontend Software Engineering roles primarily, and secondly for roles as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I am very interested in being in an environment where I can grow, learning languages such as Python, three.js, Java, C#, C++, Vue.js, etc, or bettering my growing interest in UI/UX.
